    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>Hi!  Welcome to my portfolio.  I am so happy to share with you a little bit about myself and my work.  I have ten years of experience as a teacher, in which the first two were spent in Florida, and the remainder as an English as a New Language teacher at a public school in New York.  I have my Master's Degree and am very proud to have accomplished receiving a 4.0 GPA while working as the Graduate Assistant during my studies.  Teaching refugees and newcomers was one of the greatest professional challenges that I have had, yet highly rewarding to see the bright smiles and eagerness to learn of all of my students.  Their energy was contagious and I was fortunate to have had these wonderful students in my life.  Not only did I teach them, but was taught a lot about language, culture, life and war in return.  Aside from my love of teaching, I also love to travel.  I have been on various trips to Europe as a volunteer with students from a peace organization, People to People International.  Spreading peace through understanding and connection was one of the main missions of these travels, and was started by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  More recently, I completed a tech bootcamp in Toronto at General Assembly at Bitmaker.  It was an intensive fullstack web immersive course where I learned both front end and back end technologies, and this was one of the best experiences of my life.  Canada is now one of my favorite places and my second home!  I recently booked a one-way flight to San Francisco to fullfill my dreams of breaking into tech and having the career of my dreams!  Take a look around at my portfolio to see some of the work I have done in and out of bootcamp!</p>
